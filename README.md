## Introduction

FindMeNow is a user-friendly and efficient Lost and Found application designed to simplify the process of locating and retrieving lost belongings. It offers a centralized platform where users can report lost items, search for found items, and facilitate their return. Whether you've misplaced your keys, left your phone on public transport, or found someone else's lost item, FindMeNow has got you covered.

This repository contains the collaborative development efforts of our team of four members to create this application. We believe in making a positive impact by helping people find their lost items and fostering a sense of community responsibility.
